A analog clock made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- The looks of the clock can definitely be improved but I leave that to some other day when I will have a sudden burst of motivation for creating beautiful clocks :D


> PS: the inspiration to make clocks comes from [this website](https://www.relaxingclock.com/) which I use during my 'fancy' study sessions XD.
